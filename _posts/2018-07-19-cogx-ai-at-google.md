We sponsored Charle Muirhead's inaugural Cognition-X or CogX conference in London, July 2018.  CogX
did a terrific job, packing the venue with 7000 attendees talking about a wide variety of subjects,
from GPU accelerators, to AI ethics, to AI in the cloud, to blockchain, and more.  I gave a talk
where we had to wear headsets like silent disco. You'll hear all the background noise in this video.
However, we were all tuned into my voice and the speaker background.  This was my first time with 
a silent disco style talk, a bit weird, but it works.

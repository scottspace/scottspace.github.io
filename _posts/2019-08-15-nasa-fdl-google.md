Half a century after the first moon landing, NASA plans to go back to
space and explore Mars. This time itâ€™s getting a boost from Silicon
Valley tech companies. Scott Budman reports.  

I tried to land soundbites of "AI helps you make smarter, faster
decisions" and "NASA, a pioneer in space, and Google and Intel,
pioneers in technology, have come together today."  That sure sounded
good to our team.  Scott Budman grabs my "Where's Waldo?" quote about how
NASA scientsts were using Google AI to match local pictures to a moon
map, localizing astronauts.  haha.  Happens.

Two years ago a close friend introduced me to Sara and James of NASA's
[Frontier Development Lab](https://frontierdevelopmentlab.org/).  That
initial meeting has grown into a close sponsorship between Google and
NASA FDL, an early beachhead that's helping us grow our Google Space
initiative.  I'm forever thankful for Google's marketing team, AI for
Good, Intel, Nvidia, and so many others that continue to sponsor this
wonderful program.

Moments after I joined Google Cloud, friends at Razorfish invited me to stop by
their annual
[Technology Summit](https://www.digitashealth.com/razorfish-tech-summit-some-thoughts-on-ai-and-our-emerging-screenless-world/). 
I couldn't pass it up, the chance to talk with
so many creative, technically minded professionals who were leading the development
of top websites, advertising campaigns and apps!

One of my favorite expositions on AI was authored by Wait But Why. I took the opportunity
to discuss the story of how deep learning evolved at Google, from a modest summer student
project in 2010, to the acquisition of Deep Mind in 2013, to a massive investment in 
rejiggering Google infrastructure starting in 2014.  We ended with Tim Urban's sketch
showing how the human race is on the edge of incredible change.

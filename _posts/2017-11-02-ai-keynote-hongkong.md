The Artificial Intelligence Society of Hong Kong invited me to
[stop by](https://www.amcham.org.hk/news/the-future-of-ai-in-business) while visiting Google
customers in the region.  We hosted dozens of business leaders, then discussed recent
advances in deep learning, reinforcement learning and other techniques being used by
Google and financial institutions.   The event was well received!  I certainly enjoyed
participating as a [speaker](https://www.eventbank.com/event/6338/speakers.html).

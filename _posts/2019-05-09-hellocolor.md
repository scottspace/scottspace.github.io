Using the p5.js library, we'll spin through 16,277,216 colors with your mouse in this simple, modernist abstract art.

<script src="//scott.ai/js/hello_color.js"></script>
<div id="hello-color-canvas">
</div>

The ability to influence 16,277,216 colors gives users an amazing freedom.   Simultaneous contrast -- without
which it would be impossible to perceive colors -- is illustrated here by juxtaposing a number of color
combinations.  Our perception of color is affected by colors near it. 

Place your mouse over the red rectangle.  Moving left or right controls
the size of the color field.  Moving up and down shifts the hue.

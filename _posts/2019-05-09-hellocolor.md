I'd like to add code to this site.  I've been playing with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) lately, a javascript
implementation of [Processing](https://processing.org/).
Or, as I like to call it, "computer science for poets."  P5 lets
creative minds use computer software as a paintbrush, generating art that combines the
best of humans and machines.

I yanked one of the simple demo's for p5 and wondered if I could get it working
with the github.io website framework.  Using the p5.js library, you can
now spin through 16,277,216 colors with your mouse in this simple, modernist abstract art.

<script src="//scott.ai/js/hello_color.js"></script>
<div id="hello-color-canvas">
</div>

The ability to influence 16,277,216 colors gives users an amazing freedom.   Simultaneous contrast -- without
which it would be impossible to perceive colors -- is illustrated here by juxtaposing a number of color
combinations.  Our perception of color is affected by colors near it. 

Place your mouse over the red rectangle.  Moving left or right controls
the size of the color field.  Moving up and down shifts the hue.

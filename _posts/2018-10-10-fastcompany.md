title: AI's One Percent Problem

Harry McCracken and I had a chance to chat about the "2018 AI War" for talent.  Harry keyed into statements
I made about the demand for talent in his Fast Company 
[article](https://www.fastcompany.com/40474564/how-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-great-ai-war-of-2018). 
We all see this imbalance between demand for AI and the number 
of people who have the necessary skill to deploy the latest techniques.  The article notes that perhaps
one percent of companies had sufficient AI talent, creating a race for products, services, and people.
We estimated thousands of 
machine learning experts, about a million data scientists, and perhaps 10 million programmers.  That's dwarfed
by 100 million or more technical business professionals.

Luckily, expontentials are working in our favor.  The number of students matriculating and studying
machine learning seems to be doubling every year, if not faster.  Every professor I've met who leads an AI
course talks about how they're at capacity.  Online courses are popping up everywhere, too.

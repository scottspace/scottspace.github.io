Google Ventures recently invested in UI Path, a partner of Google Cloud.  We're super excited about
the potential of robotic process automation.  UI Path leaders made a simple insight.  As humans, we often sit
in front of a screen (pixels).  We then choose actions to affect an outcome (typing, the mouse, voice).  The computer
system responds and we repeat.  Each of these tasks can be reframed as a prediction problem, allowing us
to automate the task with computer vision, natural languge processing, reinforcement learning, and good ol' fashioned
AI.  I was glad to participate in a [panel](https://www.uipath.com/inside-the-rocketship/uipath-has-officially-landed-in-bellevue)
with UI Path leaders to discuss the potential of this
insight and how its quickly and dramatically transforming enterprises from the inside out.  We visited
the site of their new US headquarters in Bellevue, Washington.  White collar work will never be the same again.

Way back in 2008 some investors wanted to build a business video platform in New York City.  The idea was to host
videos that could be embedded in other websites, then sell a "wrapper" for branding around
the content.  Think, a commercial YouTube.  Edgy content like MTV, Jack Ass and College Humor.
The major buiness problem was the cost of streaming a live video.  Sure, YouTube did it,
but it must've costed a fortune.  A small website with 5 million MAUs was spending hundreds of thousands
a month with Akamai streaming video.  We needed real advertising revenue just to break even!

I took on a project as "CTO" to move from on-premise serving with Akamai to this new fangled thing
being built by Amazon.  Everyone I talked to thought it was a stupid side project for me, with illustrious
CEOs laughing at "Simple Storage Service" from Amazon.  One famous Wall Street analyst called it a distraction, 
calling for the company to ditch these silly side projects.  Server consolidation was all the rage.
Cloud was nonsense.

Well, I took a shot at it.  We moved the entire site to the cloud in 2007, when nobody else was
paying attention.  I had just come from Photobucket where we hosted 50 million users across 3000 machines
and 3 datacenters.  That was a nightmare, with my pager going off constantly, almost always on a late
Friday evening as the week ran down.

Andy Jassy invited me to give a talk as he flew from city to city, chatting about this new cloud
business he dreamed up as Bezos' TA.  I did a blog post (long since gone) but have found the slides.  We moved 
videos to storage and migrated to cloud.  That's more normal now.  Back then, there were perhaps 20-30
people in the audience for the AWS event in New York City.

A few more people are paying attention now.

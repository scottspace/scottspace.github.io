The LendIt conference is one of the fastest growing assemblages of talent in the financial
services sector.  In 2018 the conference explored the fascinating impact of fintech companies
on the old guard.  One area of particular interest was the advent of AI.  The organizers asked
if I'd say a few words to the audience.  They added "using the Google Cloud" for the commercial
angle.  My primary interest was sharing this amazing story of learning machines with smart
executives, many of whom may not be familiar with what's happening, and just how fast things
are changing.

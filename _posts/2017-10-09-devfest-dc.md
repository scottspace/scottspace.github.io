DevFest DC is both an annual event and an organization devoted to the software
developer community in and around Washington, DC.  The organizer asked if I'd
deliver a fun keynote on the world of applied AI, and what it means to software
developers.

I flew in from California, drove around a bit, and found the hotel on the outskirts
of DC.  The room was packed!  Speaking in front of several peers who also write
software for a living was a bit intimidating, that's for sure.  I took a shot at 
summarizing the advances in deep learning, how they came about, and the potential
future of our industry.  We introduced the notion of modeling the world as tensors, 
building programs that manipulate these tensors through piecewise, nonlinear 
modifications, finally producing an output tensor.  We then use traditional methods
to interpret these tensors as predictions, artificially created images, control
system vectors, and more.

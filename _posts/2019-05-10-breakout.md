OK, I have p5 running.  Let's see if I can add some interactivity!  I Googled and found
a hacky inplementation of Atari Breakout in processing.  I ported it -- and all of its 
global variables and complete lack of good coding practive, but I digress -- and got it
running in the browser.  This sorta works.

I have now ported the game of Breakout using p5.js, embedded within a post.  The original code is a bit hacky, as
you'll need to place your mouse over the game, then use left and right arrows to control the paddle.

<script src="/js/breakout.js"></script>
<div id="breakout-canvas">
</div>

Play breakout!

### Deep Serengetti:

Deep Mind has partnered with a leading zoologist, Dr. Meredith Palmer,
to build an AI model for recognizing Tanzanian wildlife and other
activities in the Serengetti plains.  Researchers trained a model from
the [Snapshot
Serengetti](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/snapshot-serengeti)
image dataset available on [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/),
a platform for citizen science.  Details will be published later at
the [Deep Learning Indaba](http://www.deeplearningindaba.com/)
conference this month in Africa.  More information on the datasets can
be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201526).

### AI Unicorns

CB Insights have published their latest list of [AI
unicorns](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/ai-unicorn-club/), each
valued at more than $1B. The top five areas of focus
are (1) social video storytelling, (2) cybersecurity, (3) facial
recognition, (4) robotic process automation, and (5) behavioral
understanding.  Video storytelling is the dominant play.

### Fair Trade Data

We’ve heard of the Fair Trade Coffee program which ensures coffee
farmers are treated ethically, paid a sustainable wage, and earn a
fair, minimum price for their coffee beans.  In addition, Fair Trade
Coffee invests in programs to promote farming techniques that address
issues of global warming.  AI algorithms are notoriously hungry for
data, creating an opportunity for businesses to farm out the task to
tens of thousands of remote workers.  Fair Trade Data is a nascent
effort to ensure these data labelers and testers are paid a fair,
sustainable wage with a minimum price for their work.

### OpenAI Alum wins Unity Contest

@unixpickle won Unity’s Obstacle Tower VideoGame Challenge this year
using a technique that he calls
“[prierarchy](https://blog.aqnichol.com/2019/07/24/competing-in-the-obstacle-tower-challenge/).”
The math is complex but the idea is intuitive.  Train a concise AI
network to mimic human behavior (he uses an [impala
model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01561.pdf) as the policy for an
actor-critic RL algorithm). Use this as a starting point with a more
sophisticated RL algorithm
([PPO](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/rl-proximal-policy-optimization-ppo-explained-77f014ec3f12)).
The human behavior is the “prior” knowledge being injected into a raw
machine model.  Code is available
[here](https://github.com/scottspace/obs-tower2).

### DeepCode is now a startup

Three weeks ago we reported on some researchers that applied Open AI’s
language model to analyzing source code on GitHub.  The
auto-completion wowed many.  They’re now a company called
[DeepCode](https://www.deepcode.ai/) sitting on $4M in fresh cash,
looking to add more languages and productize their innovative
invention.

### BERT detects bad food on Amazon

Independent but following in the footsteps of DeepCode, [researchers
at Boston
University](https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooz030/5543660)
fed Google’s BERT language model "bad food" reports from the FDA.
They trained their model to find UPC food codes in the FDA text
and then convert these
to amazon ASIN codes.  Next, they fed the same BERT model over a
million text reviews from Amazon’s website, again training the model to
find ASIN codes.  A simple database query of ASIN values matched
Amazon reviews to recalled FDA foods.  Code is available
[here](https://github.com/scottspace/DSSG2016-UnsafeFoods).

### Monty Python’s worst Nightmare

Archaeologists have
[discovered](https://newatlas.com/heracles-giant-extinct-parrot/60917/)
the remains of an ancient, giant parrot from 19 million years ago.
Apparently this bird was about hip-high with a massive beak that could
open about anything.  Seeing how Parrot’s are intrinsic to Python --
the language of deep learning -- we asked Monty Python for a comment
on the discovery:
 
> “This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! 'E's expired and gone
> to meet 'is maker! 'E's a stiff! Bereft of life, 'e rests in peace!
> If you hadn't nailed 'im to the perch 'e'd be pushing up the daisies!
> 'Is metabolic processes are now 'istory! 'E's off the twig! 'E's
> kicked the bucket, 'e's shuffled off 'is mortal coil, run down the
> curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!! THIS IS AN
> EX-PARROT!!”

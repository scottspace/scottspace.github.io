### Honey, clean the extra bedroom!  Space guests are coming.

Astronauts on the International Space Station conducted a space walk
recently to install [a new docking
port](https://futurism.com/the-byte/new-docking-port-international-space-station)
for commercial guests. I guess you could say that AirBnB has now
reached the heavens!  A friend of mine recently purchased a ride to
the space station for $2m, off some other investors who once paid $20M
for the privilege.

Virgin Galactic is charging $250k for a shot into
space, not quite as high as the space station.  Elon Musk wants to
sell seats to Mars for $250k in the future. With that, I'd love to see
moon trips for $100k for science.  The next decade is going
to be incredible, driven by commercial competition with government
space agenecies, as well as growing competition from China.  I plan to
go. You in?

### Deep Radio Bursts in Space

Astronmers identified a [Fast Radio
Burst](https://newatlas.com/eight-new-repeating-fast-radio-bursts/61137/)
from deep space by examining astrological data from 2007.  With the
pattern in hand, they've now detected eight new repeating sources.
The signals themselves are twisted and skewed mathematically, which
may mean the source is near a black hole and undergoing a "significant
transition" - NASA speak for all hell breaking loose.  AI can help
with these signal detections, too, and chew through a lot more data,
faster.  I just hope they're not from a [microwave
oven](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/microwave-ovens-spark-radio-signals-peryton-05122015/)
someone is using for a late night snack at the telescope.

### 5 Success Stories in Reinforcement Learning

I enjoyed reading Catherine Gitau's [post](https://medium.com/@categitau/success-stories-of-reinforcement-learning-9b4064171668) on Medium. She attended the 2018 Deep Learning Indaba
conference, partially sponsored by Google, and attended by several of our researchers from
Google Brain and Deep Mind.  The best way to learn something new is to teach it, so she
signed up for a lecture on reinforcement learning, then dove in head first.  This post is a result
of that self-taught exercise.

Catherine provides a quick introduction to the field  of reinforcement
learning.  She neatly summarizes five breakthroughs over the last 8 years:  (1) the first
neural network to win at Backgammon, (2) the first neural network to conquer 50 Atari games
with four pages of math, (3) breakthroughs in fine motion control for robotics, (4) Alpha Go, the
first software system to beat world champions at Go, and (5) Alpha Zero, a program that taught
itself to beat Alpha Go, and then learned to beat the top computer chess program in just four
hours of training.

### Life is a beautiful picture.  We live in a pixel.

Wait But Why by Tim Urban and friends is one of my favorite sites.
This week I enjoyed Tim's rather philosophical piece about life being
a beautiful, breathtaking picture, yet we live every day in a single
pixel. Only through time and reflection do we see the pixels as the beautiful
life we've created.

Tim reminds us of impact bias, which basically says that we
adjust to new situations, shiny new things, new partners and, after a
while, our initial thrill has subsided to a new "normal."  That normal
feels like just any other normal, _including_ the time before we
accomplished something, acquired something, or met someone new.  Tim
hints that the keys to happiness are much more mundane.  Eat well,
exercise, sleep well, enjoy time with friends and family, and enjoy
the nature of your work.  That echoes my top priorities in life:
health, family and friends, creating, contributing.

### AI billions?  Sell Levi's and pans to the miners

Alexander Wang is but 22, an MIT dropout, a teenage coder that turned down jobs
to attend MIT, only to quit once his startup took off.  Alexander experienced
the firsthand pain of trying to gather and clean data to feed these modern
machine learning algorithms.  He and his college buddies decided to 
[do something about it](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-05/scale-ai-is-silicon-valley-s-latest-unicorn).

We reported on his startup scale.ai a few weeks ago. The press continues,
as his company essentially scrubs and cleans data and then hands it to machine
learners who then dig for gold.  I love the fact that they're worth in excess of
$1B.  General sentiment has been discounting the market of selling tools and services
to machine learners, as its "too small" and "AI is too hard to use."  By focusing where
AI is super hot, and feeding the growing population what they need to succeed,
Alexander is changing minds and becoming a true leader of the next generation of
software systems.

### Lava Lamps protect the Internet

John Graham-Cumming uses a wall of Lava Lamps at his corporate office
to [protect the
Internet](https://qz.com/1642628/cloudflare-uses-lava-lamps-to-generate-a-crucial-resource/?utm_source=email&utm_medium=daily-brief)?
What?  The SSL security and cryptographic signatures used throughout
the Internet require a random seed number to encrypt data and keep it
away from prying eyes.  One weakness, of course, is this random seed.
If you have it, you're a step closer to cracking the code.  Simply
calling rand() in C isn't good enough when nation states come knocking.

John's company CloudFlare takes an ingenious approach to randomness.  They literally
take a picture of a wall of lava lamps, complete with the light caused by the day's
weather, shadows of people passing by and more daily office chaos.  Next, they turn
this image into a series of numbers, and even more random noise, create a fingerprint
using math, and then use this number as the seed for a sophisticated Linux random
number generator.  The output of _that_ is the random seed used for encryption.

Good luck hacking that.

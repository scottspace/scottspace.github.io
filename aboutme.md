i'm scott penberthy, or dr. scott to my kid's friends. i'm an ai nerd and
science communicator. i have the following qualities:

- i believe in science.
- i like building cool things.
- i enjoy teaching ai and space.

what else do you need?

i started this site after ingesting NASA's 30-year plan.  technically, its called
the NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Astrophysics'
[Enduring Quests and Daring Visions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.3741).  The SMD's
mission is to "discover how the universe works,
explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars."

seriously.  we have a government agency whose mission sounds like the
[opening lines of StarTrek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pptCGR9N4g) from the 60s.

nasa scientists
sketched an architecture to explore solar bodies, starting with the earth, then 
practicing on our moon, before venturing to mars, europa, asteroids and more.  i'm 
excited to be part of that at Google!

the original apollo mission relied on telemtry and humans.  artificial intelligece (ai)
and its autonomous robots, vehicles, prediction powers, and more are needed for
our next stage of exploration.  lucky for me, i studied ai for my phd.

this site is dedicated to things i'll learn along the 30-year journey.  i hope to share
them with you, so that we can enjoy them together.

### my history

i was born 4 years before man walked on the moon.  i spent my childhood obsessed with
nasa, writing computer programs that simulated star trek games, apollo 11 launches, 
the lunar landar, and interstellar communications (uh, online chat, before the
internet).

i went to mit at 16 to become an astronaut.  i failed out after 2 months... my eyesight
wasn't 20/20. depressed and realizing my life was completely over (sounds like a teenager,
doesn't it?), i walked across campus.  there i ran into an open house for the MIT
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

i spent the next 4 years working in the ai lab, teaching, and building robots in the summer.
many years later, my PhD would payoff.  i started at google in 2016 doing ai fulltime,
after a career of webly things.  a year after that i met nasa, and began a relationship
that will last a lifetime.

i'm unbelievably excited to help nasa and their 30-year mission.  i'm starting
from within google, where i do "applied ai."  that's business speak for modeling
phenomena with tensor calculus and computational graphs, optimized through
deep learning, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and more.
